My apps main goal is to retrive information from the weathermap website using their api, and displaying the information that I picked out on my website.
First off, I got the API key from their website, and put it on a seperate .txt file, I then opened that file in python with the "with open" because the KEY is supposed to be sensitive information, anyways after that I made a search field so that you can search either by zip code, or by city, and the way i checked which was which is by using the isdigit() method, if it was digit then I made the URl to be zip, and if it wasnt digit then that means they serched for a city so I added the city search. After that it makes a request to the website with the information that I passed when I searched for a city, for example 'Las vegas', it then returns a response with information and I converted that to .JSON so that i can work with it in my template.
Next I checked differen't weather types, if for example the specified main weather said 'Rain' then that means its raining, so i set up a variable called 'weather_image' and I passed in a url to the image in my images folder where it can find that rainy image, and then passed that variable to the dictionary, which I then passed to the template where I can use that variable to display the image.
